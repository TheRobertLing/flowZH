        Learning any language involves plenty of reading ‚Äî Chinese is no exception. Only through
        reading can you start to understand how vocabulary and grammar work together in real
        context. FlowZH's article releases aim to provide short, self-contained and easy to digest
        reads across a variety of everyday topics (and more!) so that anyone can build confidence
        reading Chinese, one bite-sized piece at a time.
